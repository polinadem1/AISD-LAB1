The scientific objective of geodesy is to determine the size and shape of
the Earth. The practical role of geodesy is to provide a network of accurately
surveyed points on the Earth’s surface, the vertical elevations and geographic
positions of which are precisely known and, in turn, may be incorporated in
maps. When two geographic coordinates of a control point on the Earth’s
surface, its latitude and longitude, are known as well as its elevation above
sea level, the location of that point is known with accuracy within the limits
of error involved in the surveying processes. In mapping large areas, such as
a whole state or country, the irregularities in the curvature of the Earth must
be considered. A network of precisely surveyed control points provides a
skeleton to which other surveys may be tied to provide progressively finer
networks of more closely space points. The resulting networks of points have
many uses, including anchor points or bench marks for surveys of highways
and other civil features. A major use of control points is to provide reference
points to which the contour lines and other features of topographic maps are
tied. Most topographic maps are made using photogrammetric techniques
and aerial photographs.
The Earth’s figure is that of a surface called the geoid, which over the
Earth is the average sea level at each location; under the continents the geoid
is an imaginary continuation of sea level. The geoid is not a uniform spheroid,
however, because of the existence of irregularities in the attraction of gravity
from place to place on the Earth’s surface. These irregularities of the geoid
would bring about serious errors in the surveyed location of control points
if astronomical methods, which involve use of the local horizon, were used
solely in determining locations. Because of these irregularities, the reference
surface used in geodesy is that of a regular mathematical surface, an ellipsoid
of revolution that fits the geoid as closely as possible. This reference ellipsoid
is below the geoid in some places and above it in the others. Over the oceans,
mean sea level defines the geoid surface, but over the land areas the geoid is
an imaginary sea-level surface.
Today perturbations in the motions of artificial satellites are used to
define the global geoid and gravity pattern with a high degree of accuracy.
Geodetic satellites are positioned at a height of 700-800 kilometers above
the Earth. Simultaneous range observations from several laser stations fix the
position of a satellite, and radar altimeters measure directly its height over
the oceans. Results show that the geoid is irregular; in places its surface is
up to 100 metres higher than the ideal reference ellipsoid and elsewhere it is
as much as 100 metres below it. The most likely explanation for this height

variation is that the gravity (and density) anomalies are related to mantle
convection and temperature differences at depth. An important observation
that confirms this interpretation is that there is a close correlation between the
gravity anomalies and the surface expression of the Earth’s plate boundaries.
This also strengthens the idea that the ultimate driving force of tectonic plate
is a large-scale circulation of the mantle.
A similar satellite ranging technique is also used to determine the drift
rates of continents. Repeated measurements of laser light travel times between

many uses, including anchor points or bench marks for surveys of highways
and other civil features. A major use of control points is to provide reference
points to which the contour lines and other features of topographic maps are

and aerial photographs.
The Earth’s figure is that of a surface called the geoid, which over the
Earth is the average sea level at each location; under the continents the geoid
is an imaginary continuation of sea level. The geoid is not a uniform spheroid,
however, because of the existence of irregularities in the attraction of gravity
from place to place on the Earth’s surface. These irregularities of the geoid
would bring about serious errors in the surveyed location of control points
if astronomical methods, which involve use of the local horizon, were used
solely in determining locations. Because of these irregularities, the reference
surface used in geodesy is that of a regular mathematical surface, an ellipsoid
of revolution that fits the geoid as closely as possible. This reference ellipsoid
is below the geoid in some places and above it in the others. Over the oceans,
mean sea level defines the geoid surface, but over the land areas the geoid is
an imaginary sea-level surface.
Today perturbations in the motions of artificial satellites are used to
define the global geoid and gravity pattern with a high degree of accuracy.
Geodetic satellites are positioned at a height of 700-800 kilometers above
the Earth. Simultaneous range observations from several laser stations fix the
position of a satellite, and radar altimeters measure directly its height over
the oceans. Results show that the geoid is irregular; in places its surface is
up to 100 metres higher than the ideal reference ellipsoid and elsewhere it is
as much as 100 metres below it. The most likely explanation for this height

variation is that the gravity (and density) anomalies are related to mantle
convection and temperature differences at depth. An important observation
that confirms this interpretation is that there is a close correlation between the
gravity anomalies and the surface expression of the Earth’s plate boundaries.
This also strengthens the idea that the ultimate driving force of tectonic plate
is a large-scale circulation of the mantle.
A similar satellite ranging technique is also used to determine the drift
rates of continents. Repeated measurements of laser light travel times between
ground stations and satellites permit the relative movement of different control
blocks to be calculatedThe scientific objective of geodesy is to determine the size and shape of
the Earth. The practical role of geodesy is to provide a network of accurately
surveyed points on the Earth’s surface, the vertical elevations and geographic
positions of which are precisely known and, in turn, may be incorporated in
maps. When two geographic coordinates of a control point on the Earth’s
surface, its latitude and longitude, are known as well as its elevation above
sea level, the location of that point is known with accuracy within the limits
of error involved in the surveying processes. In mapping large areas, such as
a whole state or country, the irregularities in the curvature of the Earth must
be considered. A network of precisely surveyed control points provides a
skeleton to which other surveys may be tied to provide progressively finer

would bring about serious errors in the surveyed location of control points
if astronomical methods, which involve use of the local horizon, were used
solely in determining locations. Because of these irregularities, the reference
surface used in geodesy is that of a regular mathematical surface, an ellipsoid
of revolution that fits the geoid as closely as possible. This reference ellipsoid
is below the geoid in some places and above it in the others. Over the oceans,
mean sea level defines the geoid surface, but over the land areas the geoid is
an imaginary sea-level surface.
Today perturbations in the motions of artificial satellites are used to
define the global geoid and gravity pattern with a high degree of accuracy.
Geodetic satellites are positioned at a height of 700-800 kilometers above
the Earth. Simultaneous range observations from several laser stations fix the
position of a satellite, and radar altimeters measure directly its height over
the oceans. Results show that the geoid is irregular; in places its surface is
up to 100 metres higher than the ideal reference ellipsoid and elsewhere it is
as much as 100 metres below it. The most likely explanation for this height

variation is that the gravity (and density) anomalies are related to mantle
convection and temperature differences at depth. An important observation
that confirms this interpretation is that there is a close correlation between the
gravity anomalies and the surface expression of the Earth’s plate boundaries.
This also strengthens the idea that the ultimate driving force of tectonic plate
is a large-scale circulation of the mantle.
A similar satellite ranging technique is also used to determine the drift
rates of continents. Repeated measurements of laser light travel times between
ground stations and satellites permit the relative movement of different control
blocks to be calculatedThe scientific objective of geodesy is to determine the size and shape of
the Earth. The practical role of geodesy is to provide a network of accurately
surveyed points on the Earth’s surface, the vertical elevations and geographic
positions of which are precisely known and, in turn, may be incorporated in
maps. When two geographic coordinates of a control point on the Earth’s
surface, its latitude and longitude, are known as well as its elevation above
sea level, the location of that point is known with accuracy within the limits
of error involved in the surveying processes. In mapping large areas, such as
a whole state or country, the irregularities in the curvature of the Earth must
be considered. A network of precisely surveyed control points provides a
skeleton to which other surveys may be tied to provide progressively finer
networks of more closely space points. The resulting networks of points have
many uses, including anchor points or bench marks for surveys of highways
and other civil features. A major use of control points is to provide reference
points to which the contour lines and other features of topographic maps are
tied. Most topographic maps are made using photogrammetric techniques
and aerial photographs.
The Earth’s figure is that of a surface called the geoid, which over the
Earth is the average sea level at each location; under the continents the geoid
is an imaginary continuation of sea level. The geoid is not a uniform spheroid,
however, because of the existence of irregularities in the attraction of gravity
from place to place on the Earth’s surface. These irregularities of the geoid
